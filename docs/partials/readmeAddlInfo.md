`autoplay` and `autoScroll` are mutually exclusive properties and should not be used together on the same component instance. 

On mobile devices, `autoScroll` and `navigation` controls are automatically disabled.

Both `navigation` and `pagination` can be used together, but at least one must be used to give users a clear way to control the slides manually.
